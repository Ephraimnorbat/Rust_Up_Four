# Rust tutorial

#BEGINNER LEVEL:

# Introduction to Rust
1. Why Rust?
Key features: Memory safety, zero-cost abstractions, fast adoption in varius branches, No garbage collector(faster runtime),fastest language after C and ownership system.
Installation and setup.
2. Basic Syntax and Concepts
Variables and data types.
Control flow: if statements, loops.
Functions and error handling.
Ownership and borrowing.
3. Structs and Enums
Defining and using structs.
Enums and pattern matching.
4. Modules and Packages
Organizing code into modules.
Creating and using packages.
5. Error Handling
Result and Option types.
unwrap and expect for handling results.
6. Standard Library
Exploring Rust's standard library.
Common data structures and their usage.

* Resources for Beginners:

Rustlings - A collection of small exercises to get hands-on experience.

# INTERMEDIATE LEVEL:
1. Advanced Ownership
Lifetimes and references.
Borrowing patterns and avoiding common pitfalls.
2. Traits and Generics
Defining and implementing traits.
Writing generic functions and structs.
3. Introduction to concurrency in Rust.
Ownership and threading.
std::sync for shared state concurrency.
4. Advanced Pattern Matching
Advanced pattern matching with match.
Destructuring and ref patterns.
5. Advanced Error Handling
Creating custom error types.
The ? operator and From trait for conversions.

* Resources for Intermediate Learners:
Rust in Action (Book)
Async Programming in Rust

# EXPERT LEVEL:
1. Advanced Concurrency
Async programming with async/await.
Tokio and async runtime.
2. Unsafe Rust
Understanding and using unsafe code.
When and how to use unsafe blocks.
3. Compiler Internals
Exploring compiler optimizations.
Understanding the borrow checker.
4. Writing Macros
Creating procedural and declarative macros.
Advanced macro usage.
5. FFI (Foreign Function Interface)
Integrating Rust with other languages.
Writing bindings for C libraries.
Resources for Expert Learners:
The Rustonomicon (The Dark Arts of Advanced and Unsafe Rust Programming)
Rust API Guidelines
Research papers and Rust RFCs.
As learners progress through these levels, they should work on real-world projects, participate in the Rust community, and explore advanced topics based on their interests and needs. Reading the official documentation and following Rust forums and blogs will also enhance their expertise.
